*DESCRIPTION*

This notebook focuses on implementing a predictive analysis model using traditional machine learning techniques in Python. The workflow begins with importing essential libraries like pandas, numpy, and visualization tools such as matplotlib and seaborn. The dataset is then loaded, cleaned, and preprocessedâ€”steps that include handling missing values, converting categorical features using encoding techniques, and scaling numerical features for optimal model performance.

After preprocessing, the notebook proceeds with exploratory data analysis (EDA), where key trends and relationships are visualized using histograms, heatmaps, and correlation plots. These visuals help in selecting the most relevant features for the predictive model.

The core predictive modeling is done using popular machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Logistic Regression, depending on whether the task is regression or classification. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or RMSE are used to assess how well the model predicts unseen data.

Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using GridSearchCV) may also be included to optimize the model further. This notebook is a great example of end-to-end predictive analytics, from raw data to trained and tested models ready for deployment or further refinement.
